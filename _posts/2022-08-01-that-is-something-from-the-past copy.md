Start about how bad colonialism and the salve trade was
Propose current solutions, reparations ect..

Talk about if you really care about slavery, you would do something about modern slavery
talk about the 13 million 15th-19th centrury vs 40 million now
talk about how this doesnt even include things like the US prison system

US is having a prison population of nearly 2.2 million prisoners.
Nearly half (46%) of people incarcerated in state prisons in 2015 were convicted of nonviolent drug, property or public order crimes. To compete with cheaper foreign markets, these people get paid nearly zero to mass produce varies products.
talk about firefighters from prisons.


talk about how the effects of slavery are still felt in the descendants of former slaves and how to make their live better.
