In my journey of starting my own permaculture farm, one of the first steps is to find my own piece of land. A good start would be to determine which type of climate would be ideal. I'm keeping my search within the European Union, since this moving within the EU is not too much trouble, As one of the biggest requirements for good food production is proper plant growth, a high solar radiation would be ideal. At the moment the annual global horizontal radiation in the Netherlands is around 1060 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>. The solar radiation in the medeterannian is 65% higher. As plant growth follows an saturation curve if plotted against radiation, there will be a lot more possibilities in year round food production.

With the EU unfortunaly not having a tropical climate, the higher the solar radiation, the dryer and hotter the climate will be. Therefore it should be important to find a piece of land in a location with a high annual precipitation and temperatues not being too extreme. This already narrows the search, since most Mediterranean countries are far too dry. The country of Portugal already stands out since its position next to the Atlantic ocean gives it a relatively mild winter and summer compared to other Mediterranean countries.

At last land prices are very important, since in a Mediterranean climate, rainfall will occure mostly in the fall and winter. This requires the land to have sufficient catchment area and a buffer, so water is also readily available through spring and summer. These cheaper land prices are mostly found in the more rural regions of Portugal. 

While searching there rural areas, I have the following wishes for the land.
- Have a flat and inclined area. The flat area will be most suitable for the more intensive agricultural activities and can contain water buffers like ponds. The inclined area could be great for earthworks like swales to divert water into the right direction and increase water infiltration of the soil.  
- As said before, water mangement will be one of the most important aspects of growing crops in a Mediterranean climate, therefore an object like a well or a river is vital for the ideal piece of land.
- Fire hazards are always around in place like Portugal, so it would be ideal for the land to be not in a area too forested, especially by Eucalyptus trees, which oil infused biomass can be quite the fire hazard.
