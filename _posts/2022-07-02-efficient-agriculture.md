When you read about the third agricultural revolution, the so-called green revolution, there is one word most prominent; efficiency. When you look into the high tech agricultural sectors it can be seen that higher efficiencies have been reached. Higher yielding varieties, greenhouses and bigger agricultural machines. All of them have resulted in higher efficiencies when talking about the tonnes per hectare produced by farming. Although most greenhouses still have a large labour requirement, developments in machinery have caused the share of the labour force to work in agriculture to go down tremendously, as can be seen below. These two developments may seem fine. The higher yield per hectare means more food on our plates for less land use and that labour force can better be put the better use right?

<!-- All these technologies that are used to make agriculutere more efficient seem to have a downside. Breeding high yielding varieties may result in a higher yield, but is the plant also as robust to pests and drought as its parents. Breeding without oversight may even increase the amounts of poisonous substances in our food as for potatoes, the hybrids of S. tuberosum and S. brevidens produced not only the usual glycoalkaloids, but also the toxin demissidine, which is not produced in either parent. As a result we may be breeding crops that only perfom well in artificial environments. {nog niet goed genoeg} -->

One of these environments are greenhouses and vertical farms. The yield per hectare of greenhouse crops is many times higher than when grown in the open field as is the is the water efficiency, but since these greenhouses are most placed in colder climates like the Netherlands, they need to be heated, resulting in high fossil fual use. The CO<sub>2</sub> use per kilogram of produce is for example many times higher for a greenhouse grown tomato in the Netherlands than in an open field in Spain. So why not move these greenhouses to Spain and have the best of both world? A cooling system would be required in summer, resulting the need of fossil fuels. At the moment there are not many greenhouses that are not monocultures, resulting in the use of pesticides when a pest is detected, because a monoculture crop is like a buffet causing exponential growth of the pest and viruses are even worst, since they require a clearing of the crop and a thorough cleaning of the greenhouse. Vertical farms perform even worse than a traditional greenhouse since they have the same problems and they also require the need of artificial lighting.

As humans we always find a solution for each problem we face, so why don't we all just breed virus and pest resistant plant breeds and use renewable energy to fix the thermal problems of the greenhouse? Well to achieve these goals, billions of investments in R&D are required, the development of these technologies can take years and even if the problem is solved, nature is great at creating new problems by evolving its virus strains for example. It seems like modern agriculture is one big sunk cost fallacy, where just more and more resources are required the keep the system running.

Another fallacy which seems to count for modern agriculure is Gambler's conceit, which is where the gambler believes they will be a net winner at the game, and thus able to avoid going broke by exerting the self-control necessary to stop playing while still ahead in winnings. This is often expressed as “I’ll quit when I’m ahead.”Quitting while ahead is unlikely, though, since a gambler who is winning has little incentive to quit, and is instead encouraged to continue to gamble by their winning.  

Modern agriculuture has given as termedous yields, resulting in a lot less world hunger than has been seen last century. This makes it seem like modern agriculture is winning by betting against nature. But betting against nature by technological improvements has also resulted into climate catastrophes and a world wide loss in biodivesity. As said by Brad Udall, a climate and water expert at Colorado State University;

> We bend nature to serve our needs, now nature is bending us. 

So working against nature does not seem to work, so how do we work with nature? Finding the root cause of a problem is always a lot easier than solving its cause. The agricultural system is deeply ingrained in our society and to untwine it, society itself needs to fix this problem from the bottom up. The average city dweller is not used to eating food that is produced by themself, this is one of the root causes of the problem, since it is a lot easier to distance yourself from the problems caused by modern agriculture if you never face those problems. {kan mooier}      

This seems to be one of the reasons why we produce so much food and we are allowed to waste it. The tonnes of foodwaste are left wasted in the city, resulting in pests like rats. the cities waterwaste is heavy processed at waste water stations and some substances that can not be broken down end up on our crops and in our drinking water.



Create huge logistical networks just to bring food one way and waste another, while nature has solved that problem already

We have teared natures efficiency chains apart.

The "tragedy of the commons" is one way of accounting for overexploitation. 


Always talking about the increase of the world population, so more yield is required, whatever the cost

Robustness of the system , forest s city, city unstable

Our drive for efficiency has caused us to break up the lines between different organisms, causing a decline of the robustness of our system in return for a higher yield and a huge agribusiness. (see food webs and nutritional cycles)

Talk about agricultural run-off, cities get the food, the countryside gets its waste


Perennial staple crops only comprise ~4.5% of total cropland. We need less annual crops. looks more into annuals vs perennials! https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.588988/full
