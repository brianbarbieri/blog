Although the increase in entropy we as humankind are causing to the universe is neglectable. The rate at which this increase occurs is destructive to us and seems uncontrollable. With this blog I would like to talk about some of the ways we could slow down this increase and make this world livable for all of us. Although the general theme of these blog posts will be about permaculture, politics and sustainability, most of these posts will just contain my ramblings and where I write about my aggravations.
