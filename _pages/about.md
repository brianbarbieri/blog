After a couple of green revolutions, the current agricultural system produces more food per hectare than older agricultural systems. The increase in food production, makes us produce so much food that we will reach a point where the same amount of people die from obesisty than they do from starvation. The reasons for death of starvation is mostly linked to conflict. Where conflict does not occur, these green revolutions produce so much that most of the agricultural land use is used to raise livestock. Especially the first sentence mentioned here is repeated a lot by agribusiness. They are stating that they have a highest yielding system, with help of heavy mechanisation, fertilization and its use of monocultures. This statement is true and make them seem like heroes, saving the world from starvation. Unfortunaly what they do not tell is that their system is like getting a million dollar loan and boasting that you are a millionair. As with help of the current agricultural system, we are on the verge of collapse, with soil loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change as examples. With our technological advancements, we have teared natures efficiency chains apart and tried to create our own. The current agribusiness is here to create more profit for the few, while getting the world more in debt.

The agricultural system needs to get back into beign efficient, which does not mean the most production per hecatere, but the most productive for the least amount of resources. These agicultural techniques have already existed for a long time, but have recently be coined as permaculture. My view is that permaculture can not be done by the few, like the way food is produced in most of the western world at the moment. To solve our food production problems we need to get back into small scale farming, where farming is not only a business model to produce food but much more.

In my blog I will go more in dept, where I will not only write about the theoretical parts of food systems, but I will also bring you along on my journey on starting my own farm. The farm, called Modero, means to slow down.
